Rendering = the change of content on our action

DOM = Programming interface which transform web interface into a object model so that we can render each element easily ( which can understand by browser)

DOM Tree = Whene the browser loads a web page, it analyses the content of the page and creats this content in memory in the form of DOM tree

Real DOM
When Tech stacks are HTML, CSS & JS the browser uses real dOM
Real DOM is a DOM tree which replaces old DOM tree with new one on rendering  
 
1. Make a new DOM tree
2. Replace old with new
3. Analyze the DOM tree
4. Visual Appearance   
All these processes are happening in the browser, which affects the page performance this is the reason we need Framework      

Load Time = Time between hitting the url and visual appearance 

React JS uses virtual DOM
Virtual DOM = It is a DOM tree operation in which new DOM tree is going to compare with old DOM tree and only change the difference in real DOM

1. getElementById
2. querySelector
3. querySelectorAll
4. getElementByClassName
5. getElementByTagName
